# Effortless Workstation

This repo contains the cookbooks and Habitat plan file to build a Habitat package that can be run on a Windows workstation. The aim of this is to be able to create a reusable common package that can be run across all Windows 10 machines a developer might need. This is useful for times when a machine needs to be rebuilt for example.

At the moment only two applications are installed using Chocolatey:

 - Visual Studio Code
 - Firefox

## Building

To build the Habitat package on Windows, run the following command:

```powershell

```
